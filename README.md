# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

In this specific project, the overall goal was to look at ride-sharing data and use it to find the following factors:
* Total rides
* Total drivers
* Total fares
* Average fare per ride and driver

and compare the differences of these factors in different city types such as: rural, suburban, and urban.

In addition, the goal was to demonstrate our results by visualizing with graphs and creating a summary DataFrame of the data. 

## PyBer Results:

### Total Rides
- Rural        125
- Suburban     625
- Urban       1,625

### Total Drivers
- Rural         537
- Suburban     8,570
- Urban       59,602

### Total Fares
- Rural        $4,327.93
- Suburban    $19,356.33
- Urban       $39,854.38

### Average Fare Per Ride 
- Rural       $34.623440
- Suburban    $30.970128
- Urban       $24.525772

### Average Fare Per Driver
- Rural       8.059460
- Suburban    2.258615
- Urban       0.668675

### Total Fare by City Type

## Summary
In conclusion our data proved something that may have been predicted before running the analysis. Rural cities tend to have less drivers, which leads to less rides and the price for each of these trips to be higher than average. The leading type of city was urban, followed by suburban. 

To help aid this issue, the following recommendations are given to the CEO of PyBer:

- To help lower prices primarily in rural, but also in urban, implement the addition of more drivers to the area as a way of lesseining the gap noted between these two types of cities and urban cities.

- Analyze the supply vs. demand more closely between different city types.

- In urban cities, increase the the average fare price even if a slight amount to help lessen costs of fares in rural and suburban cities.

- In addition to more drivers, increase the amount of rides offered in rural cities particularly.

- Offer promotional refer codes to customers to give incentive to rural city residents to ride with PyBer and spread the use of the service, despite higher fares in comparison to urban cities.
