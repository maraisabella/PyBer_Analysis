# PyBer Analysis

## Overview

In this specific project, the overall goal was to look at ride-sharing data and use it to find the following factors:
* Total rides
* Total drivers
* Total fares
* Average fare per ride and driver

and compare the differences of these factors in different city types such as: rural, suburban, and urban.

In addition, the goal was to demonstrate our results by visualizing with graphs and creating a summary DataFrame of the data.
